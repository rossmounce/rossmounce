_[I'm cross posting this from the [OKFN version](http://science.okfn.org/2012/08/20/open-access-discussed-on-international-radio/) so I can embed the audio of the show in the post]_

Last Friday (17/08/12), representing the Open Knowledge Foundation, I had the pleasure of discussing the [new Research Councils UK (RCUK) plan](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/media/news/2012news/Pages/120716.aspx/) for all UK publicly-funded research to be published [Open Access](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iPhL8xmd0EwJ:www.soros.org/openaccess/read), on a special half hour _Voice of Russia UK_ broadcast radio discussion.

I have written about this policy [before](http://access.okfn.org/2012/03/27/the-new-rcuk-draft-open-access-mandate/) and am very supportive of it, just as I am with [Open Access in academia in general](http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2012/03/30/guest-post-open-access-to-science-for-everyone/). I personally believe it will aid transparency and equality in research - so that no researcher has an unfair advantage over another through greater/easier access to vital research literature (just _one_ of many worthy benefits arising from Open Access). But there are certainly also vocal opponents to this plan - mostly those with vested interests in keeping [the obscene profits of the traditional subscription access publishing system](http://svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/) alive (which commonly generate >30% profit margins largely derived from [the taxpayer-spending of the world's research libraries on journal subscriptions](http://edchamberlain.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/a-million-squid-you-say/)). Whilst others express vague and often unspecified "concerns" about Open Access and further still many academics are notably apathetic towards it, or are even proudly [agnostic](http://www.scilogs.com/mola_mola/confessions-of-an-open-access-agnostic/) on the issue.

Thus a publicly-broadcast discussion of this new open policy is well warranted.

I won't say anything about the discussion itself, only that you should listen to it (embedded above; alt link [here](http://ruvr.co.uk/2012_08_17/85416708/)) if you are _at all_ interested in the future of science, and the benefits of the new RCUK Open Access policy.

The members of the discussion panel included [Rita Gardner](http://www.rgs.org/AboutUs/People/Director.htm), the Director of the Royal Geographical Society, noted for her concerns about [the potential effects of Open Access on UK Learned Society income and revenue **[paywalled link]**](http://www.thebookseller.com/user/login?destination=node%2F155231); Ross Mounce, Panton Fellow promoting open data in science ([myself](http://rossmounce.co.uk/)) from the Open Knowledge Foundation; [Bjorn Brembs](http://brembs.net/), Professor at the Department of Genetics at the University of Leipzig, noted critic of [for-profit publishers and their lack of 'value-add'](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2011/11/09/functionality-academic-publishing/) amongst other issues; and [Timothy Gowers](http://gowers.wordpress.com/), the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University, instigator of the popular [academic-led boycott of the academic for-profit publisher Elsevier](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/09/frustrated-blogpost-boycott-scientific-journals).

The ensuing discussion was ably guided by VoiceofRussia radio presenter Daniel Cinna, and recorded by a backroom team with an impressively professional studio setup (Timothy & Bjorn were joining the debate via phone from abroad almost seemlessly, whilst Rita and I were in the London studio). As noted by Rita off-air, it would have been nice to have had a publisher representative in the discussion to add their unique viewpoint but apparently the VoR production team _had_ asked, but no for-profit publisher they had asked was willing to take part. So one cannot attribute any blame to the VoR team if the discussion panel lacked representational balance.

About _Voice of Russia_ (adapted from [their own website](http://ruvr.co.uk/about.html)):
