I've written 29 blog posts this year! Still time for one more...

This work relates to my new postdoc at the University of Cambridge in [Sam Brockington's](http://sambrockington.co.uk/) group.

I've been closely examining IUCN RedList data for plant taxa and found some rather odd things.

**Out of the 100 or so plant species that the IUCN RedList asserts as 'extinct', at least 16 of them are growing alive and well somewhere in the world at the moment.**

![](http://previews.123rf.com/images/roxanabalint/roxanabalint1402/roxanabalint140200262/26165233-Extinct-grunge-rubber-stamp-on-white-illustration-Stock-Vector.jpg)

For some species even Wikipedia notes the conflict between reality and the 'official' IUCN assessment e.g. for [Rauvolfia nukuhivensis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rauvolfia_nukuhivensis).

Here are the 16 plant species that I think are incorrectly assessed as 'extinct' right now by the IUCN RedList:

_Astragalus nitidiflorus, Cnidoscolus fragrans, Cynometra beddomei, Dipterocarpus cinereus, Dracaena umbraculifera, Madhuca insignis, Melicope cruciata, Ochrosia brownii, Ochrosia fatuhivensis, Ochrosia tahitensis, Pausinystalia brachythyrsum, Pouteria stenophylla, Rauvolfia nukuhivensis, Wendlandia angustifolia, Wikstroemia skottsbergiana, Wikstroemia villosa_

Additionally to the 16 above, with less certainty, I also think the Hawaiian taxa _Delissea kauaiensis_ and _Delissea niihauensis _might have some individuals still alive according to this [Department of Land and Natural Resources 'Fact Sheet' from 2013](http://dlnr.hawaii.gov/wildlife/files/2013/09/Fact-Sheet-Delissea-niihauensis-subsp-kauaiensis.pdf).



**Why not harness the wisdom of the crowds and/or semi-automated text mining?**



It's remarkable that the IUCN RedList still lists some of these as 'extinct' when there are easily findable peer-reviewed articles reporting the rediscovery and hence **_extant status_** of these taxa. To their credit, many are listed as "needs updating" but still, if there are important updates to statuses why not just go in and make the change(s) to correct the record?   The [IUCN RedList page listing _Wendlandia angustifolia_](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/31213/0) as 'extinct' is possibly the worst example - it was reported as rediscovered back in the year 2000, more than a decade ago! The IUCN has had 15 years to update their incorrect assertion of 'extinct' for this taxon!

I can't possibly go through the literature and check all other IUCN-listed plant taxa myself but this does seem like a great opportunity for [ContentMine](http://contentmine.org/) tools to help the IUCN RedList stay on top of the latest updates about IUCN RedListed taxa. See '[Daily updates on IUCN Red List species](http://contentmine.org/2015/09/daily-updates-on-iucn-red-list-species/)' for more on that idea.



Below I list sources of information relating to the 16 species that I think are definitely NOT extinct, despite being listed as such on the IUCN RedList.
