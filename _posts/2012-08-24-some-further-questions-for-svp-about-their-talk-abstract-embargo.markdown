I just sent this email to Darin Croft (of SVP). I chose to contact him because he recently answered questions about the embargo for [EmbargoWatch](http://embargowatch.wordpress.com/2012/08/03/society-of-vertebrate-paleontology-clarifies-its-pre-published-online-embargo-policy/) and it was rather unclear who else I should approach. I did _not_ want to blanket email the whole council.

This is the (entire) email I sent him, from my gmail account:
(I will post his reply as and when I receive it)




<blockquote>Dear Darin,

It's been noted many times before, by many different researchers - but the SVP meeting abstract embargo just doesn't make sense to me. I know of no other conference that operates like this, and indeed for most other conferences the abstract booklet (and it's open, free availability online) is a big promotional aid in getting people interested in the event in the lead-up to it.

I saw you answered some questions on EmbargoWatch recently, so I thought you might be the correct person to contact for my queries on the same subject:

I have blogged my own displeasure with the embargo policy here: 
[http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/08/23/the-ridiculous-svp-embargo-is-back-again/](http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/08/24/some-further-questions-for-svp-about-their-talk-abstract-embargo/)

I would like to ask:

1.)  What would happen if a researcher (and SVP member) deliberately broke the embargo and blogged/tweeted/published research that was the basis of their own submitted talk abstract (I'm surprised this hasn't happened already tbh, given how early the abstract deadline is - some e-journals have very quick turnaround times...)

2.) What would happen if a researcher (and SVP member) broke the embargo and blogged or tweeted some or all the of the content of another researcher's talk abstract

3.) If a blogger or journalist *did* write an article or two on the basis of the meeting abstract booklet - do you seriously think that could harm the chances of VP'ers getting published in one of the glamour mags? 


I look forward to hearing from you, and will publish your response in full context with this email on my blog

Best,

Ross
