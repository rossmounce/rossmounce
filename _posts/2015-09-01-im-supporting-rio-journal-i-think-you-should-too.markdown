Today (2015-09-01), marks the public announcement of [Research Ideas & Outcomes](http://riojournal.com/) (RIO for short), a new open access journal for all disciplines that seeks to open-up the entire research cycle with some truly novel features

I know what you might be thinking: _Another open access journal? Really? _

Myself, nor [Daniel Mietchen](https://twitter.com/EvoMRI) simply wouldn't be involved with this project if it was just another boring open access journal. This journal packs a mighty combination of novel features into one platform:



	
  * 1.) RIO will publish research proposals, as well as regular research outputs such as articles, data papers and software - this has never been done by a journal before to my knowledge

	
  * 
	
  * 2.) RIO will label research outputs with 'Impact Categories' based upon [UN Millennium Development Goals](http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) (MDGs) and [EU Societal Challenges](http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/societal-challenges), to highlight the real-world relevance of research and to better link-up research across disciplines (see below for some example MDGs).

  * 3.) RIO supports a variety of different types of peer-review, including '[pre-submission, author-facilitated, external peer-review](http://rio.pensoft.net/about#Pre_submission_author_facilitated_external_peer_review)' (new), as well as post-publication journal-organized open peer-review (similar to that [pioneered by F1000Research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2012.00063/full)), and 'spontaneous' (not journal-organized) post-publication open peer-review which is actively encouraged. All peer-review will be open/public, in keeping with the overall guiding philosophy of the journal to increase transparency and reduce waste in the research cycle. Reviewer comments are highly valuable; it is a waste not to make them public. When supplied, all reviewer comments will be made openly available.

	
  * 
	
  * 4.) RIO offers flexibility in publishing services and pricing in a bold attempt to 'decouple' the traditional scholarly journal into its component services. Authors & funders thus may choose to pay for the publishing services they actually want, not an inflexible bundle of different services, as there is at most journals.

  * 5.) On the technical side of things, RIO uses an integrated end-to-end XML-backed publication system for Authoring, Reviewing, Publishing, Hosting, and Archiving called [ARPHA](http://arphahub.com/). As a publishing geek this excites me greatly as it eliminates the need for typesetting, ensuring a smooth and low-cost publishing process. Reviewers can make comments inline or more generally over the entire manuscript, on the very same document and platform that the authors wrote in, much like Google Docs. This has been successfully tried and tested for years at the [Biodiversity Data Journal](http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/) and is a system now ready for wider-use.




For the above reasons and more, I'm hugely excited about this journal and am delighted to be one of their founding editors alongside Dr Daniel Mietchen. See our growing list of [Advisory](http://riojournal.com/board) and [Editorial](http://riojournal.com/browse_journal_groups.php?role_id=3) Board members for insight into who else is backing this new journal - we've got some great people on board already! If you're interested in supporting this initiative please do enquire about volunteering as an editor for the journal, we need more editors to support the broad scale and ambition of journal. You can apply via the [main website here](http://riojournal.com/).
