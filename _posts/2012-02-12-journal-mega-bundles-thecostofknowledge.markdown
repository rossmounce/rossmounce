_[Rather than summarise what's already been said about Elsevier and their for-excessive-profit practices in recent weeks, I'll just lazily assume you've read it all... right then. Here's what I have to add.]_




This post is a real-world anecdote of the problems that Elsevier's journal bundling & excessive profiteering*** causes. Just one of many reasons which persuaded me to sign my name along with 5,000+ other academics over at [The Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/), to register my disapproval of what Elsevier (and other publishers) are doing with scholarly works.




Recently, I discovered to my dismay that my institutional library (University of Bath) had cut it's subscription (and therefore easy access) to an important journal in my field. Literally, one week I had free access to the journal content, and then the next week I found I didn't!




The journal is Biology Letters, a general biology journal by Royal Society Publishing [RSP from now on]. **

Interestingly RSP take a relatively [enlightened stance](http://royalsociety.org/Royal-Society-position-statement-on-open-access/) on Open Access, and have made some interesting statements in the past, such as this gem [from a statement published way back in 2008]:


`

"…some companies do appear to be making excessive profits from the publication of researchers' papers"

`


I _think_ RSP, is a non-profit organisation ([source](http://www.facebook.com/RoyalSocietyPublishing.FanPage)) and hence it doesn't surprise me that they have such prescient criticism of Elsevier & co to offer. They aren't in the business of excessive [profiteering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profiteering_(business)) like some.




So… RSP's Biology Letters has been cut from our subscriptions budget. Why? - was the very first question I emailed the subject librarian at my institution. To their credit, I got some wonderfully informative replies from our librarian staff - I have no doubt they've done their best, given the limited powers they have. Like all institutions, we don't have an unlimited budget. _Something_ had to be cut, and unfortunately it was our subscription to Biology Letters. Which by the way, would only have cost us [£852](http://royalsocietypublishing.org/site/librarians/Pricing.xhtml) for an institutional online-only subscription. 




**Why** was this journal, of which I read/used at least 15 separate articles of in [2011 alone](http://www.citeulike.org/search/username?q=%22biology+letters%22&search=Search+library&username=rossmounce), cut from our subscriptions instead of a journal like… Elsevier's '[International Journal of Coal Geology](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/international-journal-of-coal-geology/)'?*




I think this is a fair question to ask. Biology Letters has a higher impact factor, [not that the journal Impact Factor is a particularly brilliant metric of quality](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2009.2801.1) and would cost a lot less (£1107 [Biol. Lett. print version+online] vs [2540](http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/503337/bibliographic) Euros; the current institutional subscription price for the print version 'International Journal of Coal Geology'). Most damningly of all, I suspect no-one at my institution _ever_ reads this Elsevier journal, feel free to correct me on this - I'm sure I could find plenty of other Elsevier journals that satisfy this last property.




But the answer to this question is of course not relevant to any of 3 rational above points (unfortunately) - Biology Letters can be cut because it's vulnerable, as it's not part of a MegaBundle sold by a large for-profit publisher. The International Journal of Coal Geology _cannot_ be cut because access to it comes as part of a 'Big Deal' bundle, in which there are some *vital* journals to which we *must* have access to (and the corporation selling access, knows and exploits this). So despite the fact that no one needs it here, that it's ~2x more expensive, and it has a lower Impact Factor - I have access to this, and many countless other bundled journals I DON'T need, and I DON'T have access to vital articles from another journal I *do* need for my research.




Welcome to the crazy world of academic publishing! Much of it simply doesn't make sense in the Digital Age. Of current explanations, I'd say [Mike Taylor's parable](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/10/parable-farmers-teleporting-duplicator) explains this most clearly.




I can't claim to have explained all of the problems and intricacies here - but rest assured it clearly doesn't make sense to me. Journal mega-bundling is plainly inefficient, and we can't let this practice continue.




Stop feeding the beast! [The Cost of Knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/)  




Footnotes:  

* Through-out this post I use the example of the International Journal of Coal Geology, not out of disrespect for the editorial board, or the scholarly quality of the work presented there-in - I'm sure it's great if you're into Coal Geology. I only use it because a) it's an Elsevier journal to which Elsevier very arguably adds very little value to, and b) I sincerely believe virtually no researchers at my institution make use of this journal.




** Just for the record, I don't blame RSP or my librarians for this subscription cut happening. It's out of their control. RSP do a great job IMO, as do my librarians.




*** I just read that one UK institution pays over £1,000,000 (yes, more than a million) every year for Elsevier's 'Big Deal' bundle ([source](http://edchamberlain.wordpress.com/2011/12/09/a-million-squid-you-say/)). I think this is a disgraceful ransom.
