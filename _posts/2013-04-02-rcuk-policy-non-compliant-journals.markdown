So, the new RCUK open access policy is now in play... and guess what - there's plenty of journals out there that are not accommodating it at the moment. Perhaps this is just out of ignorance? Perhaps this is an area where a little nudge from interested parties e.g. open access advocates, RCUK-funded academics, and other concerned people might help?

With this aim I have just emailed the editorial board of the Taylor & Francis journal _Systematics and Biodiversity_ to let them know that their journal is not currently RCUK-compliant (see screenshot from FACT below).

[![Systematics & Biodiversity is not compliant](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/515ab678d535cf27d700003c.jpeg)](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/515ab678d535cf27d700003c.jpeg) 



<blockquote>Dear Elliot, (and British-based members of the Systematics and Biodiversity [editorial board](http://www.tandfonline.com/action/aboutThisJournal?show=editorialBoard&journalCode=tsab20))


As you may know, Research Councils UK (RCUK) have instituted a new open access policy to further the dissemination and re-use of all RCUK-funded research. Included within RCUK is BBSRC, MRC, NERC & STFC.
Further details [here](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx) 

This policy came into force on 1st April 2013.

All papers to be published in future, arising from RCUK-funded research must now comply with this new RCUK policy or they will not be REF-able. Publishing in a non-compliant journal may also adversely affect future grant applications.

The University of Nottingham has made a helpful website to let people check before they submit their manuscripts - which journals are RCUK policy compliant, and which journals are NOT compliant.
It is called the '[Funders & Authors Compliance Tool](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/fact/index.php)' 

I was browsing this website and discovered that your journal: '[Systematics and Biodiversity](http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/tsab20/current)' (ISSN: 1477-2000) is NOT compliant with the new RCUK policy, for researchers with BBSRC, MRC, NERC or STFC funding.


This may deter many British academics from submitting manuscripts to your journal...
May I suggest you discuss this at your next editorial board meeting?

The simplest route to compliance would be to talk to your publisher - Taylor & Francis, point out the issue, and convince them to either: 

* allow all RCUK-funded research to be published under the [Creative Commons Attribution Licence](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) (CC BY)
OR
* allow the Accepted version of RCUK-funded articles to appear in open access repositories after a 6 month embargo

  
It may also interest you to note that an [entire editorial board recently resigned](http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/journals-editorial-board-resigns-in-protest-of-publishers-policy-toward-authors/43149) from a Taylor & Francis journal over a similar dispute relating to open access & licencing. I'm sure you need not necessarily take such drastic action.



All the best,


Ross

I'll let you know as and when I get a response to this email.

Perhaps you know of a journal in your field that you'd also like to see offer RCUK-compliant publishing options? Check with the FACT tool, and let that editorial board know - they may be able to do something about it [http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/fact/index.php](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/fact/index.php)
