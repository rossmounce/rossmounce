Since Sunday afternoon I've been at an [International Council for Science](http://www.icsu.org/) (ICSU) / [Royal Society](http://royalsociety.org/) invited workshop on 'Revaluing Science in the Digital Age'.

We've had a fascinating set of talks from academics, publishers (PLoS, Nature, BMC), librarians, policymakers, data managers, scientific societies...

Attendees included:

I gave a talk on content mining and the importance of full BOAI-compliant Open Access with respect to this, on behalf of the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/):









[BOAI-compliant Open Access & content mining](http://prezi.com/pdq4v-hhcc_2/boai-compliant-open-access-content-mining/) on [Prezi](http://prezi.com)







There was lots of discussion on reproducibility, provenance of data, peer review, incentives, research misconduct and ethics.

I've met many new people and have learnt many new things. For example, on the subject of reproducibility I talked about [Roger Peng and the journal Biostatistics](http://biostatistics.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/405.full) in discussion, and then was soon informed that there was an analogous journal in Chemistry called [Organic Syntheses](http://www.orgsyn.org/submission.html) whereby:


<blockquote>In order for a procedure to be accepted for publication, each reaction must be successfully repeated in the laboratory of a member of the Editorial Board at least twice, with similar yields (generally ±5%) and selectivity similar to that reported by the submitters.</blockquote>


Fantastic! We were also informed that this rigorous protocol ensures that research published in this journal is very highly regarded. I've suggested similar such reproducibility checks for phylogenetics research before (at the [Systematics Association Biennial meeting Belfast, 2011](http://prezi.com/rwyvfb9bvec_/nullius-in-calculo/)) but this was viewed as too _futuristic_ / infeasible...

Right now we're working on a draft statement of outcome from this workshop that ICSU can pass to its [members](http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/our-members) to possibly officially agree to endorse.

So I better finish here, and get back to the discussion.
I'm rather hoping they will endorse the [Panton Principles](http://pantonprinciples.org/) rather than reinvent the wheel (policy-wise).

Exciting times!
