I just got forwarded this email. (Names, Dates & email addresses have been removed or replaced).

I'm extremely concerned about this and thus am republishing this email to draw attention to it. Wiley are really pushing their expensive hybrid Open Access option '[Online Open](http://olabout.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-406241.html)' that does _not_ represent value for money in my opinion - it's US$3000 for most journals which is rather a lot.

Of course they are welcome to advertise this _option_ but it's rather disingenuous in my opinion to **make NO mention whatsoever** to authors that there are _other_ means of compliance e.g. the 'green' route to open access (self-archiving). If we're not careful some UK academics may assume they _must_ publish via the gold open access route to be RCUK-compliant, especially if they are bombarded with emails like this from all the major corporate publishers! Not cool...

-------- Original Message --------
Subject: 	Journal X complies with the Open Access policies of 
RCUK and Wellcome Trust
Date: 	
From: 	Person at Wiley Journal X
To: 	Person X

Dear Person X:

As an author who has submitted a paper to Journal X we wanted to let you know that from 1st April 2013 you will be given the choice to publish under a Creative Commons ‘Attribution’ license (CC-BY) license when using OnlineOpen, the open access option for the journal. This will ensure that if you are funded by Research Councils UK (RCUK) or the Wellcome Trust you can continue to comply with their open access policies. The option to publish Online Open is offered post-acceptance, outside the peer-review process.

The Research Councils UK (RCUK) and The Wellcome Trust (WT) have recently announced new open access policies, effective from 1 April 2013. Both policies state that to be compliant, journals must offer a “pay to publish” (gold OA) option.  When an article publication charge is paid the policies also mandate the use of the Creative Commons ‘Attribution’ license (CC-BY). The CC-BY license allows others to modify, build upon and/or distribute the licensed work (including for commercial purposes) as long as the original author is credited.

Are you funded by RCUK or the Wellcome Trust?
  
To comply with your funder’s open access policies now and beyond 1st April 2013 you can select Wiley OnlineOpen.

OnlineOpen offers:
  
1.	Publication in your first choice journal
2.	Open access to articles: freely available on Wiley Online Library, PubMed Central and UKPMC
3.	Authors retain copyright and get the choice to publish under a CC-BY License
4.	Compliance with requirements of the Wellcome Trust, RCUK and the other UKPMC Funders (see ukpmc.ac.uk/funders for list of funders.)

To keep up-to-date, please use the following link to sign up to receive future OnlineOpen emails: http://dmmsclick.wiley.com/optin.asp?sid=B92E93BH77XP7NV6T5VX&id;=619

  
Covering the cost of open access
  
With OnlineOpen the author, their funding agency, or institution pays a fee to ensure that the article is made open access. WT and RCUK are providing UK research institutions with funds to pay for article publication charges via a block allocation to support their new open access policies. This is in addition to the funding provided by the UK government to the top 30 UK research-intensive institutions to help cover the article publication charges associated with open access publishing.

In addition, Wiley has set up payment accounts with a number of UK institutions. Authors affiliated with, or funded by, an organization that has a Wiley Open Access Account can publish without directly paying any publication charges:

It is therefore advised that authors funded by the RCUK or the Wellcome Trust check with their institution regarding this available funding to pay for OnlineOpen.
