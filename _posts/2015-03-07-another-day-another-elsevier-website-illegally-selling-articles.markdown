<strike>Elsevier seem to have responded to [my criticism yesterday](http://rossmounce.co.uk/2015/03/06/elsevier-illegally-sold-me-a-creative-commons-non-commercial-licensed-article/) and have stopped selling the article "HIV infection en route to endogenization: two cases" from their [ScienceDirect website](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X15600283). Take what you will from that change, but I infer that they have realised that they are in the wrong.</strike>

Actually, they are still selling it from the ScienceDirect website too. It only looked freely available to me because I myself had paid for access to it & I guess a cookie remembered me. It's still on sale at ScienceDirect.com as well as clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com

_Further update: As of 2015-03-09 17.13 PM the articles were finally freely available 'unchained'(?) from behind Elsevier's paywalls._



So I was very surprised to find when I woke up this morning (2015-03-07), that this article, and many other CC-licensed articles in that journal are _still_ being sold via other Elsevier-owned websites e.g. the one below:Â [http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(15)60028-3/abstract](http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(15)60028-3/abstract)

I couldn't believe my eyes, so just to make sure they really were _still_ illegally selling this article that shouldn't be sold, I made another test purchase:

I heard back from Didier (the corresponding author) yesterday. He does not know why Elsevier are selling his article, nor did he give them permission to.

Elsevier ([RELX Group](http://www.relxgroup.com/)) have been doing this for many years now: selling open access articles that authors/funders have _paid-for_ to make freely available to everyone. [Peter Murray-Rust](http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2014/03/15/elsevier-are-still-mis-selling-open-access-and-behaving-illegally/), [Mike Taylor](http://svpow.com/2014/03/11/how-is-it-possible-that-elsevier-are-still-charging-for-copies-of-open-access-articles/) and [others](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/elsevier-bumps-on-road-to-open-access/2012238.article) have written about this extensively.

It is little wonder then that Elsevier is the most boycotted academic publishing company in the world: nearly [15,000 researchers have publicly declared they want nothing to do with this company](http://thecostofknowledge.com/).

I am yet to receive a refund or an apology. Alicia Wise did tweet me this:

".@emckiernan13 .@TomReller .@rmounce the journal is in transition from Wiley to Elsevier; will check on transition status" [https://twitter.com/wisealic/status/573948162794196992](https://twitter.com/wisealic/status/573948162794196992) but it is of little help...

Will I get my money back? I hope so...
