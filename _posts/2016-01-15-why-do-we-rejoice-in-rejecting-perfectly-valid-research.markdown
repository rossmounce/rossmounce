This has done the rounds on Twitter a lot recently, and justifiably-so but just in case you haven't seen it yet...







I thought I'd quickly blog about this excellent graph published on a FrontiersIn blog late last year (source/credit: [http://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/](http://blog.frontiersin.org/2015/12/21/4782/) )

With data from 570 different journals, it appears to demonstrate that rejection rate (the percentage of papers submitted, but NOT accepted for publication at a journal) has no apparent correlation with journal impact factor.





**Why is this significant?**





Well, a lot of people seem to think that 'selectivity' is good for research. That somehow by rejecting lots of perfectly valid papers submitted to a journal, it somehow ensures increased 'quality' (citations?) of the papers that _are_ eventually accepted for publication at a journal. The fact is, high rejection rates in practice indicate that a lot of good research papers are being rejected just to satisfy an unjustified fetish for arbitrary and crude pre-publication filtering. This is important evidence for advocates of the 'publish first, filter post-publication' philosophy; as put into practice by journals such as _[F1000Research](http://f1000research.com/)_ and _[Research Ideas and Outcomes](http://riojournal.com/)_.





**Release early, release often?**






Rejecting perfectly good/sound research causes delays in the dissemination of knowledge - rejected manuscripts have to be reformatted, resubmitted and re-reviewed elsewhere at great cost. The overwhelming majority of initially rejected manuscripts get published somewhere else, eventually. So why bother rejecting them in the first place, if all it does is waste time and effort?

Please show your friends the graph if they haven't already seen it. I think data like this could change a lot of people's minds...
