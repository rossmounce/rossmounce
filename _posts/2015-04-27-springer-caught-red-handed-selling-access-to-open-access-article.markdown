Today, the author of a paid-for, 'hybrid' open access article published in 2009, found that it was wrongly on sale at a Springer website:

FWIW it's still freely available at the original publisher website [here](http://www.afs-journal.org/articles/forest/full_html/2009/06/f08372/f08372.html).

To test if Springer really were just brazenly _selling_ a copy of the exact same open access article, I paid Springer to access a copy myself (screenshot below) and found it was exactly the same:

I don't actually care whether this is technically 'legal' any more. That doesn't matter. **This is scammy publishing**. I want a refund and I will be contacting Springer shortly to ask for this. The author also hopes I get a refund - he wanted his article be open access, not available for a ransom:

Frankly, I'm getting tired of writing these blog posts, but it needs to be done to record what happened, because it _keeps on happening_.

I really think we need to setup a PaywallWatch.com c.f. [RetractionWatch.com](http://retractionwatch.com/) to monitor and report on these types of incidents. It's clear the publishers don't care about this issue themselves - they get extra money from readers by making these 'mistakes' and no financial penalty if anyone does spot these mistakes. Calculated indifference.

Are these known incidences just the tip of the iceberg? How do we know this isn't happening at a greater scale, unobserved? There are more than 50 million research articles on sale at the moment. Perhaps in small part this explains the [obscene profits](http://svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/) of the legacy publishers?

It's yet [another nail in the coffin for hybrid OA](http://rossmounce.co.uk/2015/03/09/a-eulogy-for-hybrid-oa/) - we simply can't trust these publishers to keep this content open and paywall-free.

**A recap of recent incidents of selling open access articles, without the publisher acknowledging to the reader/buyer that it is an open access article:**
