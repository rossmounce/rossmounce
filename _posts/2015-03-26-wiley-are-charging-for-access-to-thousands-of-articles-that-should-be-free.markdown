_[Update 5.30PM 2015-03-26: Wiley have now 'freed' the wrongly-paywalled articles in response to this. It doesn't change the fact that these articles were wrongly on sale for 2 months and 26 days. They have also wrongly sold access to these articles.] _

**Wiley are currently (3PM 2015-03-26) charging for access to thousands of articles that should be free to access.**

They have recently (legitimately) taken control of a journal called _Limnology and Oceanography_ from the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO). The association makes clear in its guidelines for the journal that all articles are placed into Free Access after three years ([source](http://aslo.org/lo/toc/)). 

Yet today, I see that Wiley is selling access to articles from _Limnology and Oceanography_ for $45.60 USD (inc. tax). I know this because I bought access to an article myself. Screenshot at the bottom. In fact volumes 41 (1996) to 1 (1956), consisting of thousands of articles are currently on sale at Wiley.

**Some Questions:** 

How many times has Wiley sold access to articles from this journal that are greater than three years old: i.e. articles that should be free to read? 

Did the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) give them permission to sell access to articles that are more than three years old?

What do the authors think about access to their work being sold for $45.60 per article?

What do society members of the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) think about this?

Will Wiley apologise for doing this? [Elsevier hasn't yet for a similar incident](http://rossmounce.co.uk/2015/03/11/wrongly-paywalled-articles-a-recap-of-what-we-now-know/).

Will the society get fiscal compensation for this mishandling of their material?

Is this acceptable? IMO, I think not. IMO it is outrageous that Wiley are selling access to thousands of articles that should be freely available. There should be a full and open investigation into this. Relevant organisations like OASPA and UKSG should step in here. This cannot keep happening.
