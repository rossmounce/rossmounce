I'd just like to point out to anyone who asks, particularly CRC Press (part of Taylor&Francis; Group, who are in turn part of Informa PLC) that by posting the full text of my book chapter to [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/1396044/Synergistic_sharing_of_data_and_tools_to_enable_team_science) I am *not* breaching the copyright transfer agreement I signed.

Upon receiving a [copyright transfer agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_transfer_agreement) as a PDF from them via email - I [edited the PDF](http://code-industry.net/pdfeditor.php) to reword the agreement to terms that were more agreeable to **me** (e.g. I did NOT want to transfer _my_ copyright to them for _my_ work).

The bit of wording I changed is as follows: 




<blockquote>As such, copyrights in the Work will **not** inure to the benefit of the Publisher, the Publisher will **not** own the publication, its title and component parts, and all publication rights. This does **not** permit the Publisher, in its name, to copyright in the Contribution, make applications to register its copyright claim, and to renew its copyright certificate.</blockquote>




I signed this reworded form as PDF (displayed below, signature removed) and returned it to them. I have now kindly received a free 'author copy' of the printed book and my chapter has clearly been included so it's too late for CRC press to exclude my chapter. I can only assume they agreed to the reworded terms of the contract I signed and sent them.

I doubt CRC press would even be bothered by my actions to be honest. [They are allowing another of their books to be completely posted online for free](http://ropensci.org/blog/2013/12/02/open-science-with-R/), so in comparison to that, my action here is puny - but it certainly emboldens me for the next time I may have to sign a CTA form... 


CRC Press are welcome to non-exclusively publish my book chapter. Thank you CRC Press for agreeing to my terms and conditions.

Lessons one might learn from this exercise:

DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE COPYRIGHT TO YOUR WORK! 
PUBLISHERS DO NOT 'NEED' ALL YOUR COPYRIGHT TRANSFERRED TO THEM TO PUBLISH. 
ALL THAT IS NEEDED IS FOR YOU TO GRANT THEM A NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO PUBLISH.


A word of warning though... I wouldn't recommend _relying_ on this method of editing CTA's to get what you want. I was just lucky this time. Choosing an open access publication venue from the start is always the best option (if possible).
