I said I would make an update on Tuesday (today), so if I get this posted before midnight I will (_just_) have met that  goal...

In this (minor) update I have:

**added:** [Ubiquity Press](http://www.ubiquitypress.com/ubiquitypressmodel) (great low cost option!), [SPIE](http://spie.org/) (scored for 1-column per page), SAGE Open, Frontiers, WileyOpenAccess, OxfordOpen (OUP hybrid option), GigaScience, Open Biology (Royal Society)

**added the label for:** [Pensoft](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/) (sincerest apologies, it is tied with Copernicus and _was_ on the 0.1 plot, just unlabelled!)

**changed the categorization of**: Scientific Reports (NPG) [I have put it in a no-mans-land between CC BY and CC BY NC since they give authors a _choice_ of licenses. I think this is a bad idea as it allows authors to make the mistake of choosing a less open licence (are there _really_ any common circumstances in which they might want a _less_ open, free to read licence?)]

As noted elsewhere there are actually a lot of completely fee-free Gold Open Access journals out there (I shall try and make a listing of them in a future post), they're just not perhaps all that well-known. [GigaScience](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/) and [Open Biology (Royal Society)](http://rsob.royalsocietypublishing.org/site/misc/Charges.xhtml) are temporarily completely fee-free options that certainly look like good recommendations!



I shall endeavour to add-in more of a variety of the various differently priced BMC journals in the next update of the plot. Basically I believe most of them lie in the range between BMC Research Notes, and BMC Biology.

My site stats show that in just a few days v0.1 of the plot had nearly 1000 pageviews, which is HUGE for my otherwise low-key blog!

And it has had _real_ impact already. Thanks to Mike Taylor, [Acta Pal. Polonica](http://www.app.pan.pl/home.html) is thinking of adopting the CC BY licence. Brilliant news! It is fee-free but not explicitly licensed to allow re-use at the moment. Hopefully this will change soon.



Anyway, I have to get off the train now, so that'll be the end of this post.
