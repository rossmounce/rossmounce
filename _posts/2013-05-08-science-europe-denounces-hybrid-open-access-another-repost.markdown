**This is a re-post, originally first blogged by myself on the Open Knowledge Foundation main blog [here](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/05/02/science-europe-denounces-hybrid-open-access/)**

Recently [Science Europe](http://www.scienceeurope.org/about-us/about-us-full/) published a clear and concise position statement titled:
**[Principles on the Transition to Open Access to Research Publications](http://www.scienceeurope.org/downloads)**

This is an extremely timely & important document that clarifies what governments and research funders should expect during the transition to [open access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access). Unlike the recent [US OSTP public access policy](http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/02/us-white-house-announces-open-access-policy.html) which allows publishers to apply up to a 12 month access embargo (to the disgust of some scientists like [Michael Eisen](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1312)) on publicly-funded research, this new Science Europe statement makes clear that only up to a 6 month embargo at maximum should be accepted for publicly funded [STEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM_fields) research. The recent [RCUK](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx) (UK research councils) open access policy also requires 6 months embargo at most, with some caveats.

But among the many excellent principles is a particularly bold and welcome proclamation:


<blockquote>

> 
> the hybrid model, as currently defined and implemented by publishers, is not a working and viable pathway to Open Access. Any model for transition to Open Access supported by Science Europe Member Organisations must prevent ‘double dipping’ and increase cost transparency
> 
> </blockquote>


Hybrid options are typically [far more expensive](http://www.nature.com/news/495426a-i2-0-jpg-7.9679?article=1.12676) than 'pure' open access journal costs, and they don't typically aid transparency or the wider transition to open access.

The Open Knowledge Foundation heartily endorses these principles as together with the above they respect, and reinforce the need for free access AND full re-use rights to scientific research.
