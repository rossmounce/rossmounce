An interesting move from Nature Publishing Group today...

In [a press release](http://www.nature.com/press_releases/cc-licenses.html) dated 7 November 2012 they've announced they're allowing [the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) to be applied to articles in some (but not all) of their journals, specifically citing Wellcome Trust and RCUK policies that now require their funded authors to publish Gold OA with a CC BY license (or alternatively to use the Green OA route), recognizing that more restrictive licenses get the funders less return on investment.

Also included is a terribly poor quality screenshot of the new Gold OA pricing scheme that will apply for these journals (below)

An _image_ of a table of numbers like this would never be allowed to be published in any one of NPG's journals. So why did they do this here? Are they actively trying to make it harder for people to compare Gold OA charges between journals? Odd.

But what's really _outrageous_ about this: they're explicitly charging MORE for applying/allowing a CC BY license relative to the more restrictive licenses. Applying a license to a digital work costs nothing. By charging £100-400 _more_ for CC BY they're really taking the piss - charging more for **ABSOLUTELY NO ADDITIONAL EFFORT** on their part. Horrid.

Other than greed what is the justification for this? 


_UPDATE: the income made from printing paper (deadtree) reprints, for profit, is cited as the justification. This still doesn't get away from the fact that this is going to penalise RCUK-funded authors who wish to publish via the Gold OA route. I also don't remember Nature Publishing Group charging differentiated OA prices for journals that previously offered a choice of different licences - has Scientific Reports always charged different rates for different licenses? [NO it seems, just one flat price: £890](http://www.nature.com/srep/authors/index.html#costs) AND a choice of three different Creative Commons licenses including CC BY !_
