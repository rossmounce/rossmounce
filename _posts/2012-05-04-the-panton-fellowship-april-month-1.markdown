If you haven't heard yet - I was [successful in my Panton Fellowship](http://science.okfn.org/2012/04/03/introducing-our-panton-fellows/) [proposal](https://sites.google.com/site/rossmounce/misc/panton-fellowship-application-draft)

I wasn't the only successful applicant either - huge congratulations to [Sophie Kershaw](http://sophiekershaw.wordpress.com/author/sophiekershaw/) and her excellent proposal to train doctoral students how to do Open Science at Oxford University. We'll be working together on shared goals throughout the year I suspect 




As part of the Fellowship process I'll be making monthly short reports on progress and more lengthy quarterly reports.




So without further ado, here's what I've been getting up to in April:






  * For the main component of my proposal - **extracting phylogenetic data from PDF's** - I've spent the month getting up to speed with things with the expert guidance of [PMR](http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/). I even spent a whole day (16th Apr) in Cambridge with PMR working on this. Things are coming on in leaps and bounds.


  * Visited** [Digital Science](http://www.digital-science.com/)** HQ in King's Cross to have a chat with them about all the exciting web technology they're working on.


  * Successfully arranged for the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/) to have a stall, and possibly a talk at the upcoming **[Progressive Palaeontology](http://www.palass.org/modules.php?name=propal&page=81)** academic conference in Cambridge later this month.


  * Raised transparency and Open Data issues at the **Systematics Association council meeting**. As a result of this, we will soon upload our official constitution to [our website](http://www.systass.org/) to make it crystal clear what our guiding principles are. Additionally, all council members unanimously agreed in principle that we should try and make the data underlying our future [Systematics Association special volume publications](http://www.systass.org/publications/) Open Data online somewhere, somehow - but we need to get feedback and agreement from our publisher, Cambridge University Press before we proceed further with this.


  * Together with Sophie Kershaw we agreed a strategy for our OKFest plans and with the excellent help of Laura Newman submitted a talk session proposal for the **[OKfestival](http://okfestival.org/), Helsinki** later this year.


  * Attended the OKFN London **Open Science hackday**, further details on that are in my [previous blogpost](http://www.science3point0.com/palphy/2012/04/01/reflections-on-the-okfn-open-science-hackday/).







and of course this is all concurrent with my 'regular' PhD work which included, two manuscripts currently being prepared, 3 conference abstract submissions (and associated work to actually have something to write about!), undergrad demonstrating work and all the other day to day stuff.




I even had time for a small holiday over the long Bank Holiday weekend, to St Austell to see The Lost Gardens of Heligan & The Eden Project amongst other things.




It's been a busy month!







PS I've been enjoying the new HTML classes on [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/). Below I'm going to see if some of these new HTML tricks work in WordPress:




 This box should have rounded corners




This box should have a black shadow









# I can guess the number you are thinking of




Follow the Rules and then hover the card below






  1. Think of a number below 10


  2. Double the number you have


  3. Add 6


  4. Divide it by 2


  5. Subtract the original number from your answer
