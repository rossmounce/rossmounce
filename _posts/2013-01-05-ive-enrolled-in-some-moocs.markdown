I've written [about MOOCs last December](http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2012/life-as-a-palaeontologist-academia-the-internet-and-creative-commons/) but never actually enrolled in one myself... until now.

Sure, I've done [Codecademy courses](http://www.codecademy.com/users/rmounce) and [Codeschool courses](http://www.codeschool.com/users/216502) which I've immensely enjoyed but they're perhaps(?) not quite the same thing.

This year I've decided to bite the bullet and do [some Coursera courses](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/9f7a7225ad2f7d7d5444f06d0cad0a0d) (depicted below, confusingly there are different courses run by different teams with the exact same titles/topics):

The more I think about it - why not? It's free to enrol. It's free to drop-out & ignore if you don't have the time for it, or you realise it's too easy/hard/uninteresting. WHY NOT?

So I've sent a few tweets out that _unashamedly_ I'm enrolling in some Coursera courses this year and not unsurprisingly found that other people I respect are also dipping their toes in the MOOC water: [@gawbul](https://twitter.com/gawbul) (Steve Moss, University of Hull) a fellow PhD student, is also taking many of the same courses that caught my eye.

Some initial observations:



	
  * Coursera definitely isn't [Open](http://opendefinition.org/). I see no Creative Commons licenses anywhere - you probably can't repost or remix the content provided on each of these courses which is a big shame IMO. It's an MFOC (free rather than open) not a MOOC, but sadly few would recognize this distinction.



	
  * [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) is running the [Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/course/compdata) course. I'm a huge fan of reproducible research, I got my [first little peer-reviewed contribution in Nature](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7359/abs/nature10266.html) simply through reproducing (and finding significant error with) published research - it's _really_ cool to see lectures from someone you kinda idolise. There's 0% chance of personal interaction with him through the course; there's simply too many thousands enrolled but still that's pretty cool - a big name draw.



	
  * The sheer diversity of people enrolled in the courses is very inspiring, in one discussion thread of IT professionals I find [Ahmed from Sudan](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/8cb242ef5ee77dc091d5612caec1d049) "Software Architect Trying to Learn more about Statistics and Business" and [Gurneet from India](https://www.coursera.org/user/i/2e98b747f4846649baf060c65128a72a), old and young people from across the globe all wanting to learn. I really do get that warm fuzzy feeling that MOOCs could contribute _significantly_ to educating the world and making it a better place. It's not about replacing or being the alternative to a college degree, it's just about learning what you want to learn and feeding curiosity.



	
  * Without looking at any of the lectures or materials on my first attempt I managed to get 9/10 on the first Computing for Data Analysis quiz assessment (which I've since re-attempted to get the full 10/10 score). So at week 1, introducing R and data manipulation in R, it's fairly easy for me. But even so it did help me tighten-up, refresh and test my knowledge. I'm looking forward to week 2 of the course starting 9th January. And especially the start of the Machine Learning & NLP courses. These will be invaluable for my postdoc work I suspect...


So far so good. Do let me know in the comments if you've signed down for a MOOC too, I'd be interested to know. At first I felt mildly guilty as a PhD student enrolling for these things but now I see it's a no brainer - if you have time for it, and it might benefit you - why not give it a try? There's no shame in that.
