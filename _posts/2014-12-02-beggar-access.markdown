Nature has announced a [press release](http://www.nature.com/press_releases/share-nature-content.html) about a new scheme they've come up with to legalise begging to view research.

**Before**

The situation before this scheme was that the [scholarly poor](http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/10/06/the-scholarly-poor-industry/) would beg for access via private social media (email) and public social media (e.g. twitter #icanhazpdf). Kind, privileged subscribers with access to Nature magazine would then privately pass along a printable PDF copy via untrackable/untraceable '[dark social](http://www.techopedia.com/definition/29027/dark-social)' means.

**After**

After this announcement, the situation won't change much. The printable-PDF that most people use and want is [still under a 6 month embargo](https://twitter.com/Richvn/status/539722672247418880). It can't be posted to an institutional repository.

The scholarly poor, without a Nature subscription, will still need to beg subscribers for access to specific articles they want. Only now this begging is more clearly legalised. Nature will graciously, formally _allow_ privileged subscribers to share an extremely rights-restricted locked-down view of Nature articles with their scholarly poor friends. These view-only articles CANNOT be printed, presumably because that would enable untrackable 'offline' sharing of research.

Which makes me think? What are the real reasons behind this new policy?

[Macmillan Publishers Ltd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macmillan_Publishers) who publish Nature, also run [Digital Science](http://www.digital-science.com/) who are an investor of [Altmetric.com](http://www.altmetric.com/) AND an investor in [ReadCube](https://www.readcube.com/about).

It's clear that this new policy is major PR for ReadCube - the links will presumably direct to Nature articles view-only within ReadCube. The more subtle boost is also for Altmetric.com & the [altmetrics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics) of all shared Nature articles.

_If_ this PR stunt converts some dark social sharing of PDFs into public, trackable, traceable sharing of research via non-dark social means (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Google+ ...) this will increase the altmetrics of Nature relative to other journals and that may in-turn be something that benefits [Altmetric.com](http://www.altmetric.com/)



I'm sorry to be so cynical about this PR stunt, but it really doesn't appear to change much. It will convert a small amount of semi-legal 'dark social' sharing, into _formally legal_ public social sharing of research.

It has legalised begging.

It also panders to those that think true [open access publishing is "a solution for a problem that does not exist"](https://twitter.com/WvSchaik/status/539712492621287424). A shrewd measure [retarding the progress towards the inevitability of open access](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/08/open-access-research-inevitable-nature-editor).



Congratulations Nature, hmmm...?



For less cynical posts see Wilbanks review: [Nature's Shareware Moment](http://del-fi.org/post/104125242971/natures-shareware-moment), and Michael Eisen's '[Is Nature’s “free to view” a magnanimous gesture or a cynical ploy?](http://www.michaeleisen.org/blog/?p=1668)'.



**Update:**_ It's come to my attention that the 'annotation' function that the press release mentions is also likely to be a ReadCube-only feature. This is classic [lock-in strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in). Please DO NOT annotate any Nature papers you read using Beggar Access. Macmillan / Digital Science / ReadCube are clearly looking to monetize annotations on their proprietary platform_.

<del>_Also, it looks like blind & visually-impaired people don't benefit from this. I don't think standard screen-reading software works with ReadCube._</del>_ Thanks to a suggestion from [@derivadow](https://twitter.com/derivadow) I tried the [ChromeVox](http://www.chromevox.com/) screen-reader plugin and that seemed to work, it could read-out all the words. I do not know if it works with popular screen-reader software like Orca or JAWS._
