In the last 2 weeks I've given talks in Brussels & Amsterdam.

The [first one](http://www.slideshare.net/rossmounce/content-mining) was given during a European Commission (Brussels) [working group meeting on Text & Data Mining](http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/). There were perhaps only ~30 people in the room for that.

The [second presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/rossmounce/simple-additions-to-metadata) was given just a few days ago at [Beyond The PDF 2](http://www.force11.org/Making%20It%20Happen) (#btpdf2) in Amsterdam.

I uploaded the slides from both of these talks to Slideshare just before or after I gave each talk to help maximize their impact. Since then they've had nearly 1000 views according to my Slideshare analytics dashboard. 

It's not just the view count I'm impressed with. The global reach is also pretty cool too (see below, created with [BatchGeo](http://batchgeo.com/)):

Now obviously, these view counts don't always mean that the viewers always went through all the slides, and a minority of the view-count are bots crawling the web but still I'm pretty pleased. Imagine if I hadn't uploaded my Content Mining presentation to the public web? I would have travelled all the way to Brussels and back again (in the same day!) for the benefit of *just* ~30 people (albeit rather important people!). Instead, over 800 people have had the opportunity to view my slides, from all over the world (although, admittedly mostly just US & Europe).

**The moral of this short story: upload your slides & tweet about them whenever you give a talk!** 
You may not appreciate just how big your potential audience could be. Something academics sceptical of Open Access should perhaps think about?

Particular thanks should go to [@openscience](https://twitter.com/openscience) for helping disseminate these slides far and wide. During just a 60 minute period, upon first release, thanks to @openscience and others my PDF metadata slidedeck got over 100 views this Wednesday!

Next step... must work on getting these stats into an [ImpactStory](http://impactstory.org/) widget for the next version of my CV!
