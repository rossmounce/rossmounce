_[Update 2015-09-19: since writing this, I notice my open access article has now been [unpaywalled at Wiley's site](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390406/abstract). No-one from Wiley has reached out to me to explain how, why, or when this happened. No compensation has been offered, nor any apology. I note that all the other articles in the [special section](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.172.v39:4/issuetoc#group4), which should also be open access (CC BY) are still on sale, behind a paywall. Selling access to articles that should be open access is very scammy publishing. Shame on Wiley.]_

I got invited to review a manuscript by a British Ecological Society journal ([MEE](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)2041-210X)) that is published with Wiley recently.

**I rejected the request and will from now on decline to review for all Wiley journals.** In this post I duplicate my email to the Assistant Editor (Chris Greaves) explaining why. FWIW Chris has handled my letter extremely well and will forward it on for me to where it needs to be seen/read within the British Ecological Society.

Below is the email I sent earlier today in full:

Dear Chris,

Thank you (and Rich FitzJohn) for inviting me to review this manuscript.

It looks interesting from the abstract and in other circumstances I would certainly agree to review it.

However, I refused to review this manuscript and will refuse to review any subsequent manuscript for this publisher (Wiley) because I believe they are actively impeding progress in science by choosing to operate a predominately subscription-based business model - artificially restricting access to knowledge that taxpayers (through government funding) and charities [predominantly](https://www.research.hsbc.com/midas/Res/RDV?ao=20&key=RxArFbnG1P&n=360010.PDF)[ fund](https://www.research.hsbc.com/midas/Res/RDV?ao=20&key=RxArFbnG1P&n=360010.PDF). Furthermore they do an extremely poor job of it.



	
  * They produce but actively withhold full text XML (even from subscribers). Reputable open access publishers have no qualms in making their full text XML available to all. This is deeply frustrating for those interested in synthesis, reproducibility and getting the most from published science in a time-efficient manner. As the manuscript I was just asked to review was principally about 'automated content analysis' I find this particularly galling and I am wondering why the authors thought it was appropriate to submit this to such a journal.

	
  * They use an outdated back-end system: 'ManuscriptCentral' which is by all accounts an extremely poor system. Wiley have made huge profits each and every year in the past decade and yet seem completely unwilling to re-invest that in improving their systems. There wasn't even a free text box to explain my reasons for declining to review this manuscript. Utterly poor, neglected design. Try PeerJ or Pensoft's submission system. They have clearly worked hard and invested time and effort into making publishing research better for everyone, not just their own profit-margin.

	
  * Wiley's hybrid open access charge ($3000) is outrageously expensive and bears no resemblance or link to the actual cost of production or services provided. I am aware of the 'discount' levied for British Ecological Society members (down to $2,250). The 'discount' is only gained if one of the authors pays ~ [$80 to join BES](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/membership/) (full, ordinary member rate). That is still far too high. For context, some other open access fees: _PLOS ONE_ charges $1350, _PeerJ_ just $99 per author (the manuscript I was just asked to review has only 4 authors), Ubiquity Press journals [$500](http://www.ubiquitypress.com/site/publish/), and _Biodiversity Data Journal_ is still FREE ($0) whilst in launch phase. This to me is strong evidence of either deep inefficiency or profit-gouging or a mixture of both on Wiley's part, none of which are excusable. I am certainly not alone in thinking this. See recent tweets from Rob Lanfear (an excellent scientist): [https://twitter.com/RobLanfear/status/630523174061342720](https://twitter.com/RobLanfear/status/630523174061342720)[https://twitter.com/RobLanfear/status/630526920086568960](https://twitter.com/RobLanfear/status/630526920086568960)

	
  * Wiley are a significant player in the modern oligopoly of academic publisher knowledge racketeering. Data from FOI requests in the UK show that in the last five years (2010-2014), 125 UK Higher Education Institutes have collectively spent nearly [£77,000,000](http://f1000research.com/articles/3-274/v3) renting access to knowledge that Wiley has captured. That's just the UK. Wiley doesn't pay authors for their content, nor do they pay reviewers. I don't know why the British Ecological Society (BES) partners with these racketeers – I find this arrangement severely detrimental to the goals of BES and academic research.

	
  * Like the other big knowledge racketeers Wiley operate a 'big bundle' subscription system. By adding BES journals to this big bundle of subscriber-only knowledge, it makes it harder for libraries around the world to cancel their subscriptions to this big bundle. Wiley know this and hence are actively trying to acquire as many good journals as possible (e.g. ESA journals) to make themselves 'too big to cancel'.

	
  * On a personal note, I am particularly aggrieved with Wiley because they are currently, without my consent, charging $45.60 including tax, to 'non-subscribers' for access to [one of my open access articles](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bult.2013.1720390406/abstract) that they have copied over from where it is [freely available at the original publisher](https://asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_Mounce.html). Charging $45.60 to access something that is freely available at the original publisher is simply astonishing and is just another facet to the lunacy of the many and multiple ways in which Wiley and companies like it seek to profiteer from and restrict access to research.


For all these reasons and many more I simply cannot agree to review manuscripts for any Wiley journal. I am already [boycotting Elsevier](http://thecostofknowledge.com/), and am considering applying the same to subscription-access Nature Springer and Taylor & Francis journals for similar reasons.

I urge the British Ecological Society to reconsider their 'partnership' with this profiteering entity and to pursue publishing with organisations that are actually competent at modern 21st century academic publishing, particularly those that support and actively facilitate content mining e.g. Pensoft, PLOS, PeerJ, eLife, Ubiquity Press, MDPI and F1000Research, to name but a few.

Sincerely,

Ross Mounce



-----------------------------------

I feel relieved to have done this. Having reviewed for Wiley only last month it didn't feel right. Why would I help them whilst boycotting Elsevier? They are essentially as bad as each other. My position is more logically consistent now.

Many thanks to others who have also publicly written about refusing to review for legacy publishers, these posts certainly helped me in my decision-making:

_PS Having read Tom Pollard's [post on this matter](http://tomp.io/refuse-to-review.html), I might also write to one of the authors to explain why I declined to review their article. I wish them them well and I look forward to reading their article when it comes out._
