There are a lot of really interesting works being published over at [Research Ideas and Outcomes](http://riojournal.com/about) (RIO).  If you aren't already following the updates you can do so via [RSS](http://riojournal.com/rss.php), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RIOJournal), or via [email](http://riojournal.com/) (scroll to the bottom for sign-up).

In this post I'm going to discuss why [Chad Hammond's contribution](http://rio.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=9115) is so remarkable and why it could represent an exciting model for a more transparent and more immediate future of scholarly communications.

[![Version1](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/version1.png)](http://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=8615&display_type=list&element_type=8)













So, what's special?

Well, to state the obvious first: **it's a grant proposal**, not a research article. RIO Journal has published quite a lot of research proposals now, it's becoming a real strength of the journal. But that's not the _really_ interesting thing about it. The _really_ cool thing is that Chad published this grant proposal with RIO _before_ it was submitted it to the funder (Canadian Institutes of Health Research) for evaluation.

You'll see [the publication date of Version 1 of the work is 24th March 2016](http://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=8615&display_type=list&element_type=8). Pleasingly, _after_ publication in RIO Chad's proposal was evaluated by CIHR and awarded research funding. Chad received news of this in late April:

...and the story gets even better from here because thanks to RIO's unique technology called [ARPHA](http://arphahub.com/), Chad was able to re-import his published article back into editing mode, to update the proposal to acknowledge that it had been funded:


<blockquote>This proposal was submitted to and received funding from the annual Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) competition for postdoctoral fellowships.</blockquote>


The updated proposal was then checked by the editorial team and republished as an updated version of the original proposal: [Version 2](http://rio.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=9115), making-use of [CrossMark](http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/) technology to formally link the two versions and to make sure readers are always made aware if a newer version of the work exists. Chad's updated proposal now has a little 'Funded' button appended to it (see below), to indicate that this proposal has been successfully funded. We hope to see many more such successfully funded proposals published at RIO.

With permission given, Chad was also able to supply some of the reviewer comments passed to him from CIHR reviewers as supplementary data to the updated Version 2 proposal. These will undoubtedly provide invaluable insight into reviewing processes for many.

Finally, for funders and publishing-tech geeks: you should really take note of the lovely [machine-readable XML-formatted version of Chad's proposal](http://rio.pensoft.net/lib/ajax_srv/article_elements_srv.php?action=download_xml&item_id=9115). Pensoft has machine-readable XML output _as standard_, not just PDF and HTML. Funding agencies around the world would do well to think closely about the value of having XML-formatted machine-readable grant proposal submissions. There's serious value to this and I think it's something we'll see more of in the future. Pensoft is actively looking to work with funders to develop further these ideas and approaches for _genuinely_ adding-value to scholarly communications.
RIO is truly an innovative journal don't you think?
