I'm really pleased this new Open Access paper has just been published.

_Some backgroundâ€¦_




After parading my Open Data t-shirt (pictured below) around the [Society of Vertebrate Paleontology meeting](http://www.vertpaleo.org/meetings/) this month, I was invited to give an impromptu pitch in front of the great and good of the [Mammal AToL project](http://mammaltree.informatics.sunysb.edu/) & [MorphoBank](http://www.morphobank.org/) people. Having pointed out to MorphoBank a while ago that they should really make explicit the terms and conditions [license] under which they make their (?) data available, I naturally advocated [CC-BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) and [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) licences. I talked about this very subject and pleaded with them NOT to use the NC clause refering to Rod Page & Peter Murray-Rust 's [1,2] thoughts on the matter.

_Data providers vs Data re-users - need they really be in opposition?_




The trouble is, a lot of (data providing) institutions seem hell-bent on 'protecting commercial interests', at the expense of research opportunities. So as I understand it, at the moment databases such as these face an awkward problem of either satisfying the restriction requests of data providers OR satisfying permissiveness of re-use by data re-users [such as myself!], and the needs of both camps are seldom entirely met.




_Conclusion_




I see this paper as an important step in persuading such restriction-minded institutions of the absolute importance of #OpenData / #[PantonPrinciples](http://pantonprinciples.org/) and how NC clauses can genuinely obstruct and impair real academic research.  

I just hope people read it and take note!




[Most of this is just a re-post of my spur of the moment G+ post [here](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109536929126322188570/posts/QokQ7pWAkHu).  

I'm reposting here so that this might hopefully get picked up by [Research Blogging](http://researchblogging.org/) to give this paper the publicity it deserves. Much of the content is widely applicable IMO to most of scholarly communications, not just biodiversity informatics, and indeed the whole [ZooKeys special issue](http://www.pensoft.net/journals/zookeys/issue/150/) (Open Access) is well worth a browse.]
