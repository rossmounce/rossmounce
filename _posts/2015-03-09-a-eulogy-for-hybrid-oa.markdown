  * you weren't much loved in your short existence

	
  * you weren't much use to readers or text-miners because we often couldn't find where you were - hiding amongst shadows.

	
  * you were [significantly more expensive](http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/03/03/the-reckoning-an-analysis-of-wellcome-trust-open-access-spend-2013-14/) than your 'full' open access cousins




In March, 2015 'hybrid OA' died after a short-life of neglect. [Elsevier put the final nail in the coffin](https://thewinnower.com/papers/elsevier-illegally-sold-me-a-creative-commons-non-commercial-licensed-article), but it wasn't just they who were responsible, other publishers were plainly guilty of hybrid OA neglect too.

Publishers gave birth to the cash-cow that was hybrid OA not long ago. The profits were immense: [$5000 for a single article in some greedy cases](http://www.elsevier.com/about/open-access/open-access-options). Yet after each 'hybrid OA' article was born, and the profit raked in, the hybrid OA articles were completely neglected post-publication. Much like their shuttered, not-allowed-to-play-outside-the-paywall brothers & sister articles. They were forgotten about, even though their authors had stumped-up significant funds upfront to ensure their freedom forever.

[![Hybrid OA - a cash-cow](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-09-164400_1299x855_scrot.png)](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/2015-03-09-164400_1299x855_scrot.png)

Hybrid OA was a wonderfully profitable system for the publisher/carers. It enabled bountiful [double-dipping](http://www.rluk.ac.uk/about-us/blog/the-costs-of-double-dipping/) - additional revenue for providing exactly the same content. Laughably, the publisher/carers claimed  that it was "[not happening at all](https://adamesmith.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/nov-2014-the-empire-strikes-back-alicia-wise-elsevier-profile.pdf)", but anyone with a brain knew better.

But too much neglect of the hybrids over the years led to [many](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/elsevier-bumps-on-road-to-open-access/2012238.article) [high-profile](https://thewinnower.com/papers/elsevier-illegally-sold-me-a-creative-commons-non-commercial-licensed-article) instances of **triple-dipping**: subscription revenue, APC fees, AND $31.50 (+ tax) per article reader charges (for content that had already been paid to be made free for readers, forever).

A variety of [rightly](https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-funding/open-access-policy/) [concerned](http://blog.wellcome.ac.uk/2015/03/03/the-reckoning-an-analysis-of-wellcome-trust-open-access-spend-2013-14/) [funders](https://osc.hul.harvard.edu/hope) started a trend banning authors from sending their articles to hybrid OA profiteer-merchants, for their own good. Only full OA venues could be trusted to _actually do the job_ and the keep the articles _outside_ paywalls.

In short, legacy publishers _themselves_ killed hybrid OA through their own carelessness. **Authors, librarians, research funders and readers simply didn't _trust _publishers to do hybrid OA properly**, and had amassed plenty of evidence of their ineptitude. They tried to sweep the problem of a flawed and difficult system under the carpet as just '[bumps in the road](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/elsevier-bumps-on-road-to-open-access/2012238.article)' to open access but actually** hybrid OA was just a wrong turn all along.**
