I've been invited to come in and have an informal chat about open access with the [Linnean Society](http://www.linnean.org/) on March 24th this month. Particularly with regard to what is and what is not 'open access' in terms of Creative Commons licences. I write this blog post to spur on other advocates to try and encourage their society journals to use proper, open access compliant article licencing that _facilitates_ rather than prevents text & data mining.

I have Tom Simpson at LinnSoc to thank for reaching out to make this happen. Thanks Tom!

It started from some tweets I sent a few days ago about an interesting [new Zoo J Linn paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zoj.12111) by Martin Brazeau & Matt Friedman. I'd include a pretty figure from this paper if I was allowed to, but unfortunately because it's licensed with the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/) (CC BY-NC-ND) I can't. To repost _just_ a figure from the paper would be to create a smaller derivative work which the licence does not allow - I am only allowed to repost the *whole* article with absolutely no changes which is rather impractical for a 43 page article! Wiley in particular have a history of threatening scientist bloggers for reproducing a single figure from an article ([read the Shelley Batts story here](http://boingboing.net/2007/04/26/wiley-threatens-scie.html)).

[![restricted access](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.10.25.png)](http://rossmounce.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screen-Shot-2013-01-08-at-11.10.25.png)

It's not just bloggers, and the outreach possibilities for the paper that are harmed with the use of such restrictive licenses - it also causes problems for RCUK funded researchers. Matt Friedman is based at Oxford at the moment - if the funding for this work came from any of the UK research councils, then the choice of the CC BY-NC-ND license could cause him problems - **it is NOT compliant with the [RCUK's policy on open access](http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/outputs/)**. Wiley should know better than to offer this license to UK-based authors, but they have a significant conflict of interest in ensuring researchers choose more _restrictive_ licencing options so that they can continue to be the sole proprietor of glossy reprint copies (ensured by the -NC clause). Both the -NC & the -ND clauses incidentally [prevent the figures from being re-used on Wikipedia](http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC#Incompatibility), another sad restriction for the authors who must have put a lot of effort into them.

In the realm of academic _science_, the application of that particular license to the paper-as-a-whole-work just doesn't make sense. Many digital research projects _need_ to be able excerpt, transform and translate research outputs such as academic papers, and in some cases create commercial value from this. My current BBSRC-funded research project '[PLUTo: Phyloinformatic Literature Unlocking Tools. Software for making published phyloinformatic data discoverable, open, and reusable](http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/pa/grants/AwardDetails.aspx?FundingReference=BB/K015702/1)' relies on being allowed to transform, excerpt and republish extracted content from scientific papers. With [Peter Murray-Rust](https://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/) we're using text & image mining tools to generate open, re-usable phylogenetic data directly from the published literature, often directly from PDFs.  The Linnean Society have several good quality, well-respected journals which publish phylogenetic content, so they're very much in the scope of our PLUTo work.

But **clauses such as -ND stop us from using this material**. It's clear in the license terms and conditions - we are not allowed to make any derivative works from the original. So any papers using CC BY-NC-ND we will have to avoid. We cannot use them, and therefore they will not be cited by our project which is rather a shame for their authors.

Above all the CC BY-NC-ND license simply isn't compliant with the very definition of open access as laid down over a decade ago at the [Berlin, Budapest, Bethesda meetings](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read). Wiley are knowingly mis-labelling articles using non-compliant licences as 'open access' even though they are by definition NOT open access. I hope the Linnean Society can spur Wiley to do something about this as it is not good for the journal, or its authors. Other journals using non-compliant licencing use terms like '[public access](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Research_Public_Access_Act)' or '[free access](http://www.routledge.com/articles/free_access_to_food_tourism_on_taylor_francis_online/)' or '[sponsored access](https://www.elsevier.com/physical-sciences/mathematics/sponsored-access)'. Why can't Wiley follow this lead? Open access is more than just free access - it enables re-use which is critical for research projects like mine. Please stop the '[openwashing](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1934)'.
