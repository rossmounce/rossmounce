[Back when this blog was first started, it was hosted on www.science3point0.com (now defunct), and it was called Palaeophylophenomics]  

1.) <del>It’s a</del> _formerly was a_ [Googlewhackblatt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack)

2.) It’s a [Portmantaeu word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau) combining my principle research interests, namely: Palaeontology (UK spelling!), Phylogenetics, and Phenomics sensu O’Leary and Kaufman (2011).

3.) Basically a convenient, informative unique identifier for this new blog.
