Welcome to my blog.

You'll find I write posts on academia, open access, biodiversity informatics, phylogenetics, palaeontology, conferences, hackathons and other such here.

I'm currently a postdoc at the Dept. of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge. I studied Biology as an undergrad student at [Imperial College](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/), progressed to a Masters degree at the NHM, before completing my PhD at the University of Bath.

As a direct consequence of my research I have become involved with the [Open Knowledge Foundation](http://okfn.org/), particularly the [Open Science Working Group](http://science.okfn.org/) as I think there is much room for improvement in the way that science is currently done - particularly with regard to providing Open Data & Code in re-usable and frictionless ways.

As of 2012 I am a [Panton Fellow](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/03/30/introducing-our-panton-fellows/) & [council member of the Systematics Association](http://www.systass.org/council/2012council.shtml)

Some of the themes of my research are demonstrated in this presentation below:



If I was doing research with molecular sequences I’d have [GenBank](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), and life would be a lot easier. But for morphological data – it’s an entirely different ball game. There are databases <del>but not many people in this community use them</del> like [MorphoBank](http://www.morphobank.org/index.php/Projects/Index) & [Dryad](http://datadryad.org/) which I'm glad to say people are using more and more now, although they didn't in the recent past.

I use this blog as a platform for open comment on [Open Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).
